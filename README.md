# Andrew Zaruba's Dog Matching Service

Hello! This is my implementation of a basic web app matching the user with the best dog possible.

This app is written in TypeScript, React, and uses the Material UI component library.

NOTE: Safari users will have to disable the "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" setting under Settings > Privacy or the app will not authenticate correctly.

## Running Locally

Run `npm i -D` to install packages.

Run `npm run dev` to run the app locally.

Open a browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`.

## Running Tests
To run unit tests, after installing packages run `npm test`.
